# CocaCola-Fair-Game
This is a simple educational quiz game built on the Unity engine. All scripts are written in C#.
Getting Started: The game currently contains over 300 questions.
Questions are stored in TextController. Each question shows you a job and you need to select a respective major that will give you a job on that field.
Right now, I have over 250 job options stored in the text controller. Each question has one correct answer, and 3 dummy answers.
Each time you get an answer right, you will get an increase on your streak point, however answering a question will have you start the quiz from streak zero.
Sound And Display: For sounds effects, the wrong answers play a nasty horn, while correct answers will play a bell.
The right choice highlights the button green and the wrong red.
